# first_portfolio

## Description
- What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project was to demonstrate that i can succesfully create a .html file, .css file, and deploy it on github

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project to practice advanced css techniques like flex and media queries

- What problem does it solve?
Prior to this project, I had no online portfolio. So now, I can put future projects on this web app to show to future employers

-What did you learn?
css can be very challenging. I learned that it is much easier to start with a moble screen size and eventually work my way up to tablet and desktop. I had a hard time with flex, especially because i didnt have my content on html before i started working on it.

## Credits
I want to give a shoutout to my teacher, my classmates, and my friends who assisted me to debug my code when it broke
